# Hello_world
A repository is the basic unit of GitHub, most commonly a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, including images â€“ anything your project needs. Because we recommend including a README, or a file describing the project, in every repository, GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository.
